- **Sort products based on your preferences**: Users can sort the list of available houses based on their preferences. This could include sorting by price, year of construction or size. Sorting options provide users with flexibility in how they want to explore the available listings.
- **View detailed listing descriptions**: Each listing includes a detailed description of the property, providing users with important information such as property features, amenities, and any other relevant details. This allows users to make informed decisions when browsing through listings.
- **Enjoy a responsive and user-friendly design**: The web application features a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
